      <h1>A Few words I Wanted to Say....</h1>
      <p><i><b>Hiiii…
      <span class="radhe">राधे.... राधे.... &#129672;</span></b>
        
Sorry for the belated</i> <b>*Janamdin Mubarak*, <i>Devi jiiii…</b>.

Hope you are enjoying your life and doing well.

I am talking to you after a long time, and that’s okay — I just needed to share a few things.

Please read this note till the end.

I am not writing this note to seek forgiveness or to convince you — I just wanted to express what was in my heart. Because some thoughts feel lighter only when shared.

When I came to Chennai, I had no intention of making new friends. I just wanted to complete my time there and leave. 
Then I met you. On the first day, I didn’t get any good feeling from you — I don’t even know why. I told myself, “Why should I care ? In the end, all girls are the same… they just play with feelings.” Some of my own friends had been like that, so trusting people was not easy for me.
        
My life was going smoothly… everything felt simple and predictable. 
But then, in those last 7 days, we crossed paths again. Neither of us expected to become friends, yet somehow it just happened on its own. I treated you like any other friend, until that lipstick incident made you upset with me. And I don’t know why… but the moment you got upset, something inside me hurt more than I expected. That’s when I realized I felt something for you — something deeper. If you hadn’t been upset, I probably wouldn’t have understood how much you mattered to me. Eventually, things went back to normal between us. And yes, mistakes happen… no one can deny that.

As the days passed, I found myself <b>caring for you</b> more than I ever intended to… and somewhere inside, I knew it wasn’t the right thing. Maybe that’s why I couldn’t speak to you properly when you came to Chennai again and then left — it was easier to distance myself than to deal with the feelings I was trying to hide. I kept telling you that we shouldn’t talk this way, because I was scared that it would affect both of our futures. After your birthday, I stepped back for the same reason. But you take things so lightly… you never notice when someone is speaking from a place of truth and emotion.
        
Even then, I couldn’t completely stop myself, and slowly you also understood what I felt for you. Even after knowing everything, you didn’t stop me — and that was your choice, so I won’t say anything about it.

But the way you are behaving now is not right. I will never forget how you made me feel. You treated me like “use and throw,” and that </i> <b>**hurt a lot**</b>. <i>I am not saying you used me — I am saying you</i> <b>** thought **</b> <i>of me like a use-and-throw person, and that is wrong.

For the past few months, I haven’t tried to contact you. That doesn’t mean I can’t — it means I</i> <b>**don’t want to**</b>, <i>and I won’t in the future also, because the way you treated me was not right. 
<i>But somewhere in my heart I still feel that maybe, when the</i> <b>*right time*</b></i> <i>comes</i>, <b>"I might come back again"</b>. <i>Even I don’t know why. <b>**Tum jaise ho, mujhe  waise hi pasand ho... shayad issi liye tum itne khaas ho.**</b> 
    
You asked me for 5 reasons behind my <b>obsession...</b> now you already know the answer, some feelings are meant to be felt, not explained. Never think that I was attracted to your outer appearance (which may be here today and gone tomorrow). If that were the case, I would have forgotten you by now. I was drawn to <b>your innocence (मासूमियत / सादगी) — I still am, and I always will be.</b>

You once told someone that you have</i> <b>“friend-zoned”</b> <i>me.
But that word is for boys who run behind you trying to impress you — not for me. Whatever I did was never to impress you. I did it because you are special to me, and I wanted you to feel that special feeling. So keep that word</i> <b>“friend-zone”</b> <i>for others, not for me.

You also said you never had any feelings for me, which is why you never did anything for me. But that’s not fully true. You did things unknowingly. For example, when you were at home and I asked you for a video call just because I wanted to see you — you still did it, even if you had to find a little space</i> <b>*away from your family*</b> <i>for that call. Not everyone does that. Maybe it was normal for you, but it was not normal for me. So please don’t say you never did anything.

And one more thing: if you ever get time, check my call history. I called you every day, even after you blocked me. That shows the real effort — that I remembered you every single day, regardless of what the outcome would be. You may think I am acting childish... honestly, even I don't know why I am doing all of this. </i> <b>*I just feel like doing it for you.*</b><i>Your name is still saved as <b>*Home*</b> <i>in my mobile, just like you had suggested and it will remain the same.
But you won’t value it, because when someone gets something without effort, they usually don’t understand its worth. That’s human nature.

I tried everything to stop thinking about you, but I couldn’t, and honestly, I didn't even wish to. Yet, I value what you said, and that’s why I am choosing to <b>let you go.</b> Because I can’t be someone’s <b>“maybe”. You won’t make me a priority</b>, and I can’t reduce myself to being just an option.
So letting you go is the only way to protect my own heart.

There's a piece of poetry I want you to read. These words aren't mine, but they stayed with me... maybe because they carry the same ache my heart once felt.</i><i></p> 
<div class="poem">Kehnde zehr vekh ke peeta — te kī peeta? ....
Ishq soch ke kītā — te kī kītā? ....
Dil de ke dil lainde āās rakhī ve Bulleya, ....
Pyaar vī lāālach nāāl kītā — te kī kītā? ....

      <!-- POET NAME ON RIGHT SIDE -->
      <div class="poet">
        — Baba Bulleh Shah
        <span>“The Father of Punjabi Enlightenment”</span> </div>     <p>
Now, What I am going to say might upset you, but please… don’t get angry. You don’t know this, but your anger genuinely scares me sometimes — not because you are strict, but because I care too much.
I had planned your birthday gift long before. I wanted it to reach you safely, but there were reasons, so I sent it straight to your home. Please don’t be mad… every decision I made came from a place of love, not carelessness.
</i><b>**1st reason:**</b><i>
When I planned the gift, I hoped I would somehow convince you, but I couldn’t. And I wasn’t sure if you would take care of it properly on your own. If I were there with you, it wouldn’t have been a problem — but I am not there anymore. That’s why I decided to send it to your home… because at least there, it will be taken care of.
</i><b>**2nd reason:**</b><i>
I don’t want to know where you are or what you are doing.
That’s why I sent the courier directly to your home.

The parcel has gone in Ananya’s name, and by the time you read this note, the parcel will probably already have reached. So don’t be angry.

Please don't take any of my actions in the wrong way. I am saying this because you never notice my positive intentions — you only see the negative side. 
  
Whatever I have written is not to force you, not to make you feel guilty, not to trouble you, not to make your life complicated. It’s simply because these feelings deserved <b>honesty.</b>

I know my feelings are my own responsibility, and I am not blaming you for not feeling the same. But whatever you did, that is wrong.

If at any point I made you uncomfortable or crossed a line, I truly didn’t mean to. Maybe I also misunderstood some things — that could be my mistake too.

You only gave me a few hours from your 12 days in chennai.... and in return, I gave you the kind of efforts I never offer to just anyone — only to someone who holds a special place in</i> <b>my journey</b>
Sometimes I can't even believe in myself — that I could do so much for someone. And you are the only one in front of whom I never think about myself. 
I am communicating with you through this webpage because as long as I exist, this note will also continue to exist.

<i>Just pray that the </i><b>*right time*</b> <i>never comes…</i> <b>"the moment when I might return to you again".</b><i>
  
I genuinely wish you all the <b>happiness</b> in life, even if I am not a part of it.</i>

Aur haan, ek last baat… jo photo tumne Ananya ko bheje the, usme tum waise toh hamesha ki tarah <b>cute</b> lag rahe the, par woh specs na tumhare sath justice nahi kar rha hai. Tumhare face thore round aur soft hai — toh agar tum softer edges wale specs try karoge, trust me… tumhari woh asli <b>‘cute troublemaker’</b> vibe phir se shine karegi....
