      <h1>A Few words I Wanted to Say....</h1>
      <p><i><b>Hiiii…</b>

Sorry for the belated</i> <b>*Janamdin Mubarak*, <i>Devi jiiii…</b>.

Hope you are enjoying your life and doing well.

I am talking to you after a long time, and that’s okay — I just needed to share a few things.

Please read this note till the end.

I am not writing this note to seek forgiveness or to convince you — I just wanted to express what was in my heart.

When I came to Chennai, I had no intention of making new friends. I only wanted to finish my training and leave.
Then I met you in Chennai. On the first day, I didn’t get any good feeling from you — I don’t even know why. I thought, “Why should I care? In the end, all girls are the same, they just play with feelings.” Some of my own friends were like that, so trusting people was not easy for me. My only focus was finishing the training.

My life was going very smoothly…
But then, in those last 7 days, we met again. Neither of us planned to be friends, but it still happened naturally. I treated you like a normal friend until that lipstick incident made you upset with me. I don’t know why, but when you got upset, it hurt me a lot. After that, I realized I had feelings for you. If you hadn't been upset, it wouldn't have mattered to me the way it did. That’s why I thought of giving you that sketch, just so you would forgive me. Eventually everything became normal again. Mistakes happen — no one can deny that.

As days passed, I slowly began to care for you more than before, which I know was wrong. That’s why I didn’t talk properly to you when you visited Chennai again and then left. I told you many times that we shouldn’t talk like this because it wouldn’t be right for our future. After your birthday, I even stopped talking for that reason. But you take everything lightly, and you never listen when someone says something serious.

Even then, I couldn’t completely stop myself, and slowly you also understood what I felt for you. Even after knowing everything, you didn’t stop me — and that was your choice, so I won’t say anything about it.

But the way you are behaving now is not right. I will never forget how you made me feel. You treated me like “use and throw,” and that </i> <b>**hurt a lot**</b>. <i>I am not saying you used me — I am saying you</i> <b>** thought **</b> <i>of me like a use-and-throw person, and that is wrong.

For the past few months, I haven’t tried to contact you. That doesn’t mean I can’t — it means I</i> <b>**don’t want to**</b>, <i>and I won’t in the future also, because the way you treated me was not right. But somewhere in my heart I still feel that maybe, when the</i> <b>*right time*</b></i> <i>comes</i>, <b>"I might come back again"</b>. <i>Even I don’t know why.

You once told someone that you have</i> <b>“friend-zoned”</b> <i>me.
But that word is for boys who run behind you trying to impress you — not for me. Whatever I did was never to impress you. I did it because you are special to me, and I wanted you to feel that special feeling. So keep that word</i> <b>“friend-zone”</b> <i>for others, not for me.

You also said you never had any feelings for me, which is why you never did anything for me. But that’s not fully true. You did things unknowingly. For example, when you were at home and I asked you for a video call just because I wanted to see you — you still did it, even if you had to find a little space</i> <b>*away from your family*</b> <i>for that call. Not everyone does that. Maybe it was normal for you, but it was not normal for me. So please don’t say you never did anything.

And one more thing: if you ever get time, check my call history. I called you every day, even after you blocked me. That shows the real effort — that I remembered you every single day, regardless of what the outcome would be. You may think I am acting childish... honestly, even I don't know why I am doing all of this. </i> <b>*I just feel like doing it for you.*</b> <i>But you won’t value it, because when someone gets something without effort, they usually don’t understand its worth. That’s human nature.

I tried everything to stop thinking about you, but I couldn’t, and honestly, I didn't even wish to. Yet, I value what you said, and that’s why I am choosing to let you go.

There's a piece of poetry I want you to read. These words aren't mine, but they stayed with me... maybe because they carry the same ache my heart once felt.</i><i></p> 
<div class="poem">Kehnde zehr vekh ke peeta — te kī peeta? ....

Now, what I am going to say might make you angry, but please don’t get angry. I honestly get scared of your anger sometimes.
I had planned your birthday gift long ago. I wanted it to reach you, so I sent it directly to your home. Please don’t get angry— there were reasons.
</i><b>**1st reason:**</b><i>
When I planned the gift, I thought somehow I would convince you. But I couldn’t. And I was not sure if you would take care of it properly, so I sent it to your home. At least there, it will be taken care of.
</i><b>**2nd reason:**</b><i>
I don’t want to know where you are or what you are doing.
That’s why I sent the courier directly to your home.

The parcel has gone in Ananya’s name, and I have not sent anything weird. By the time you read this note, the parcel will probably already have reached. So please don’t be angry.

Pls don't take any of my actions in the wrong way. I am saying this because you never notice my positive intentions — you only see the negative side. 
  
Whatever I have written is not to force you or make you feel guilty. I just wanted to express everything honestly.

I know my feelings are my own responsibility, and I am not blaming you for not feeling the same. But whatever you did, that is wrong.

If at any point I made you uncomfortable or crossed a line, I truly didn’t mean to. Maybe I also misunderstood some things — that could be my mistake too.

You only gave me a few hours from your 12 days in chennai.... and in return, I gave you the kind of efforts I never offer to just anyone — only to someone who holds a special place in</i> <b>my journey</b>
Sometimes I can't even believe in myself — that I could do so much for someone. And you are the only one in front of whom I never think about myself. 
I am communicating with you through this webpage because as long as I exist, this note will also continue to exist.

<i>Just pray that the </i><b>*right time*</b> <i>never comes…</i> <b>"the moment when I might return to you again".</b><i>

Always be happy and safe.

I genuinely wish you all the <b>happiness</b> in life, even if I am not a part of it.</i></p>
